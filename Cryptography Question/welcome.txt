Let me tell you about Julius Caesar. He started using Caesar cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

The password is
YZH(878GBC 8BFC87 8C7999 F8AFB ADA8GG 8GGCC7 A7F9EG 8BFDAB)
But, is it though ?
